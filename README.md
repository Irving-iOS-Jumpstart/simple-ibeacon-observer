Simple iBeacon Observer Swift App

This is the companion app to the Irving-iOS-Jumpstart meetup held March 31, 2015.  An Apple Developer Program membership is requred to run this code on a device. The code will not work completely in the Xcode iPhone simulator. Also, iBeacon development requires an iPhone 4S or newer device.

A specific iBeacon UUID is hard coded into this program.

Most code obtained from iBeacon example obtained from PubNub article with a few modifications. http://www.pubnub.com/blog/smart-ibeacon-communication-in-the-swift-programming-language/
